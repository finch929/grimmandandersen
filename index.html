    <p>
As I am writing this I am coughing up more dirt, an unfortunate side effect of my current predicament. Bummer. The colors are strange here. The life I used to live was technicolor, this place lacks any saturation. There are other people here, but I only see them in the shadows or scurrying down the streets. Odd. I found an abandoned building near the outskirts of this city, if you can call it that. I’m holed up there for now. Will update soon with more information.

Curiously,
Grimm
